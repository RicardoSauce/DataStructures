# DataStructures
C++ Implementations of some data structures

This Data Structures course lasted the duration of the Fall 2017 semester.
In this course, I was exposed to C++ 11, and learned how to create many data structures using
STL and ADT's. From this, my understanding of sorting algorithms, queues, stacks, and computer architecture
in general has increased since before the course.
